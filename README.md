# Angry Dino

## Thanks for checking out Angry Dino!

How would a dino look like if it was an angry? This theme tries to answer this question.
Obviously it is a dark theme, but it is not just a dark theme.
Since everyone knows that an angry dino would have an orange and purple stripes, thats a given, but of course thats not all.
There are also some other colors which you can explore. ^^
And that is exactly what this theme is about. It is about exploring the unknown, the angry, the dino.
Enjoy! (ofc it\'s free)
